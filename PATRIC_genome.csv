Our NTS collection from Malawi, spanning a six year period (1998 to 2004), showed that amongst isolates of NTS associated with invasive bacteraemia, Salmonella Bovismorbificans (antigen profile 6,8:r:1,5) was the third most common serovar after Typhimurium and Enteritidis.  S. Bovismorbificans is an important veterinary pathogen causing salmonellosis in cattle, sheep and horses. It also poses a problem as a zoonotic agent sporadically infecting humans. Methodology Using Next Generation Sequencing technology, the genome of S. Bovismorbificans strain 3114, a paediatric bacteraemia isolate from Malawi, was sequenced. We further investigated the genomes of 13 additional Malawian bacteraemia isolates and four veterinary isolates from the UK, to identify genomic variations. Principal Findings The core genome of S. Bovismorbificans is highly stable, sharing high similarity and co-linearity with that of S. Typhimurium.  Three prophage-related regions of difference (RODs), define the major regions of genetic variation between S. Bovismorbificans human bacteraemia isolates from Malawi and veterinary isolates from the UK. Isolates differed further in the carriage of a S. Bovismorbificans virulence plasmid (pVIRBov), which was present in all bacteraemia isolates but absent from three of the four veterinary isolates investigated. Although genome degradation through pseudogene formation was observed in S. Bovismorbificans isolates, the identity of the pseudogenes was different from those identified previously in genome sequenced S. Typhimurium isolates, and there was no clear distinction between Malawi and UK isolates. In contrast to S. Typhimurium, where a distinct MLST type is associated with invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that S. Bovismorbificans isolates from Malawi belong to the most common international S. Bovismorbificans Sequence Type, ST-142.  Conclusions Differences in the accessory genome of S. Bovismorbificans isolates from Malawi may have contributed to the development of a more specialized pathotype of S. Bovismorbificans ST142 in sub-Saharan Africa.",,"2014-12-08T22:12:48.373Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:FDA CVM","2017-07-23T01:15:31.220Z","2017-07-23T01:15:31.220Z"

Typhimurium from Malawi and Kenya identified a dominant type, designated ST313, currently rarely reported outside Africa. Whole genome sequencing of a multiple drug resistant (MDR) ST313 NTS isolate, D23580, identified a distinct prophage repertoire and a composite genetic element encoding MDR genes located on a virulence-associated plasmid. Further, there was evidence of genome degradation, including pseudogene formation and chromosomal  deletions, when compared to other S. Typhimurium genome sequences. Some of this genome degradation involved genes previously implicated in virulence of S. Typhimurium or genes for which the orthologues in S. Typhi are either pseudogenes or are absent.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:FDA CVM < CDC","2017-07-23T01:23:00.977Z","2017-07-23T01:23:00.977Z"

Whole genome sequence revealed a large novel genomic island encoding resistance to heavy metals (SGI-3) is characteristic of the monophasic epidemic strains from other Typhimurium isolates in the current epidemic and may have contributed to the epidemiological success.
