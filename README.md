Scripts for figures in Typhimurium review paper

In the paper [**Genome Variation and Molecular Epidemiology of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Pathovariants**](https://iai.asm.org/content/86/8/e00079-18.short). **Figure 2** was based on my analysis:

## FIG 2

Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovars and S. Typhimurium strains. Maximum-likelihood trees of 15 S. enterica subspecies I serovars (A) and 194 S. Typhimurium strains (B) based on sequence variation in the core genome. Trees are midpoint rooted (filled black circle). (B) The inner circle indicates the source animal host species for each S. Typhimurium strain, with color code as shown in the key. The outer circle indicates ST19 (black line), other STs (gray box), and strains with an unassigned ST (line break). Strains with a published complete, closed genome sequence are indicated by small black circles at leaf nodes, and the names of key strains are in italics. The locations of key clades are indicated with boldface black font. The positions of two major clades containing strains with distinct epidemiology are indicated near the root (# and *).

![**Figure 2B**](Typhimurium_mlst-circle-smaller.pdf) is made by the [Rscript](Plot_R134_patric_DT160_BII_110118.R).
and [**Figure 2A**](Salmonella-tree-3.pdf) from the [Rscript](SubspI_011217.R).
